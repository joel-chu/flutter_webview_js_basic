# flutter_webview_js_basic

This is a demo to show you how to communicate from Flutter to your HTML page, 
then from your HTML page back to your Flutter app.

Reason is I found a lot of really crappy tutorials out in the web (And they are on the top search results! shitty google). 
Some of them are outdated, and most of them just couldn't really explain it clearly 
(and the worst it, write tutorial example without any context, just badly written copy and paste piece)

Again, DIY and you will learn better.
