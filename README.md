# webview_with_vue3

This is a demo how to communicate from Flutter to your HTML page, then from your HTML page back to your Flutter app.

Reason is I found a lot of really crappy tutorial out in the web. Some of them are outdated, and most of them 
just couldn't really explain it clearly (and the worst it, write tutorial example without any context)

Again, DIY and you will learn better.

## @TODO

We will show more sophisticate scenario with Vue and Pinia
